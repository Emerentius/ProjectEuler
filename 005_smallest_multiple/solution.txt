solution has every prime factor as often as the maximum multiplicity
of the prime factor among the numbers 1-20
need to only look at pure powers to find maximum multiplicity
2  - 4 times (16)
3  - 2 times (9)

all further squares are > 20

solution = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560
