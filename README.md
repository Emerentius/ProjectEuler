# Project Euler

![Project Euler Progress](https://projecteuler.net/profile/Emerentius.png)

These are my solutions for the popular mathematical programming puzzle site [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). Most solutions are in Rust, some are in Python, mainly for the BigInts and matrices.

Each problem has its own, self-sufficient cargo project. The programs can therefore be run via `cargo run --release` from inside the respective folders.
The Python solutions are all in Python3.

Some solutions are well thought out, some are quick and dirty brute forces.
